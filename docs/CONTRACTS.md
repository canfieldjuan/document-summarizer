# Domain Contracts

This document describes contracts implemented by the Rust core in
`src-tauri/src/pipeline`. The TypeScript frontend selects files, invokes Tauri
commands, and renders results; it does not assign identity, hash bytes, write
SQLite, or mutate pipeline state.

## `PipelineRun`
Represents an instance of processing a document.

```rust
pub struct PipelineRun {
    pub run_id: String,
    pub document_id: String,
    pub state: PipelineState,
    pub state_version: u32,
    pub pipeline_version: String,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub started_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub completed_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub current_stage: Option<PipelineStage>,
    pub progress: PipelineProgress,
    pub warnings: Vec<PipelineWarning>,
    pub failure: Option<PipelineFailure>,
    pub cancellation_requested: bool,
    pub resumable: bool,
}
```

`resumable` records checkpoint eligibility metadata only. Automatic active-run
detection and a resume command are not implemented in the current slice.

## `PipelineEvent`
An immutable ledger entry indicating a transition from one state to another.

```rust
pub struct PipelineEvent {
    pub event_id: String,
    pub run_id: String,
    pub sequence_no: u32,
    pub previous_state: Option<PipelineState>,
    pub next_state: PipelineState,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub stage: Option<PipelineStage>,
    pub work_unit_id: Option<String>,
    pub reason: Option<String>,
}
```

## `PipelineState`
The absolute truth of what step is currently active or completed.

```rust
pub enum PipelineState {
    Received,
    Ingesting,
    Ingested,
    Parsing,
    Parsed,
    VisualAnalysisRequired,
    VisualAnalyzing,
    VisualAnalyzed,
    Normalizing,
    Normalized,
    Structuring,
    Structured,
    Chunking,
    Chunked,
    Analyzing,
    Analyzed,
    Synthesizing,
    Synthesized,
    Verifying,
    Verified,
    Complete,
    CompleteWithWarnings,
    Failed,
    Cancelling,
    Cancelled,
}
```

## `IngestedDocument`

An ingested document stores a generated `document_id`, original filename, file
type, exact number of bytes read and hashed, SHA-256 content hash, canonical
source path, and creation timestamp. Ingestion opens the source read-only and
does not copy, rewrite, or otherwise modify it.

Before parsing, the source is read again and both its byte size and SHA-256 are
compared with this durable identity. A missing or changed source becomes a
structured parse failure; bytes from a different file are never persisted under
the original document ID.

The Slice 1 duplicate policy is intentionally trace-first: ingesting identical
bytes again creates a new document and a new pipeline run. Their content hashes
match, while both document IDs and run IDs remain independent.

PDF ingestion performs candidate validation only: the selected path must have a
`.pdf` extension and the opened bytes must begin with `%PDF-`. Structural PDF
validation belongs to the parser stage.

## Durable transition boundary

Normal pipeline code changes state only through the SQLite-backed transition
operation, which requires `run_id`, expected state, expected version, and next
state. A successful transaction updates state/version and appends its event.
An invalid or stale transition changes neither. `pipeline_events` has a unique
per-run sequence and SQLite triggers reject update or deletion.

## Long-term replaceability seams

- Parser implementations implement `DocumentParser::parse(&IngestedDocument)`
  and return either `ParsedDocument` or structured `PipelineFailure`. No
  PDF-library type crosses or is persisted at this boundary.
- `DocumentNormalizer` accepts only parser-neutral `ParsedDocument` and emits
  the canonical `NormalizedDocument` consumed by future downstream stages.
  PDF-library types are not part of either normalization contract. Future DOCX,
  OCR, and vision paths must converge into this canonical representation with
  an appropriate `SourceType`.
- `ModelRuntime` accepts a provider-neutral `ModelRequest` and returns either a
  `ModelResponse` or structured `ModelRuntimeFailure`. Generic run state and
  artifact persistence contain no model-family or SDK types. The first adapter
  uses an OpenAI-compatible exact-loopback HTTP endpoint and can be replaced
  without changing analysis, synthesis, verification, or Connect contracts.

## `ParsedDocument` (Slice 2)

```rust
pub struct ParsedDocument {
    pub document_id: String,
    pub parser_id: String,
    pub parser_version: String,
    pub pages: Vec<ParsedPage>,
    pub warnings: Vec<PipelineWarning>,
}

pub struct ParsedPage {
    pub page_number: u32,
    pub text: String,
    pub warnings: Vec<PipelineWarning>,
    pub requires_visual_processing: bool,
}
```

Pages are one-based and stored in canonical source order. Empty native text is
valid: the page remains present, receives `NO_NATIVE_TEXT`, and sets
`requires_visual_processing = true`. If every page lacks native text, the
document also receives `NO_NATIVE_TEXT_IN_DOCUMENT`. These markers route future
OCR/vision work; they do not perform it.

Parsed artifacts are stored by pipeline run, preserving the run-to-document
relationship and parser identity/version. Artifact insertion, the transition
to `PARSED`, state-version increment, and `PARSED` event append share one SQLite
transaction.

## `NormalizedDocument` (Slice 3)

```rust
pub struct NormalizedDocument {
    pub document_id: String,
    pub normalization_version: String,
    pub pages: Vec<NormalizedPage>,
    pub warnings: Vec<PipelineWarning>,
}

pub struct NormalizedPage {
    pub page_number: u32,
    pub content: Vec<NormalizedBlock>,
    pub warnings: Vec<PipelineWarning>,
    pub requires_visual_processing: bool,
}

pub struct NormalizedBlock {
    pub block_id: String,
    pub kind: NormalizedBlockKind,
    pub text: String,
    pub source: SourceSpan,
}

pub struct SourceSpan {
    pub page_start: u32,
    pub page_end: u32,
    pub section_id: Option<String>,
    pub source_type: SourceType,
}
```

Normalization version `1.0.0` creates one `Text` block for each non-empty
native-text page. Empty pages remain in position with no blocks and retain their
warnings and visual-processing marker. Block IDs are deterministic SHA-256
identities derived from document ID, normalization version, page number, and
block order. Current spans are page-local with `source_type = NativeText` and no
section ID.

Permitted cleaning is limited to normalizing CRLF/CR line endings to LF and
removing NUL while preserving all other controls, tabs, spaces, blank lines,
Unicode, punctuation, and substantive source text. Any cleanup adds
`REPRESENTATION_CLEANUP_APPLIED`; no repeated header/footer removal or structural
interpretation occurs.

Validation requires matching document identity and normalization version,
unchanged page count/order/numbers, preserved warnings and visual-routing
markers, exact text after the permitted cleanup, deterministic unique block
IDs, and page-local source spans that reference existing pages. The schema-v3
normalized artifact stores its version, document/run association, serialized
artifact JSON, and SHA-256 integrity hash. Artifact insertion, `NORMALIZING ->
NORMALIZED`, state-version increment, and event append commit in one SQLite
transaction; retrieval verifies the stored hash, artifact metadata, and run-to-document association.

## `StructuredDocument` (Slice 4)

```rust
pub struct StructuredDocument {
    pub document_id: String,
    pub structure_version: String,
    pub pages: Vec<StructurePage>,
    pub nodes: Vec<StructureNode>,
    pub warnings: Vec<PipelineWarning>,
}

pub struct StructureNode {
    pub node_id: String,
    pub kind: StructureNodeKind,
    pub title: Option<String>,
    pub level: u32,
    pub block_ids: Vec<String>,
    pub source_spans: Vec<SourceSpan>,
    pub children: Vec<StructureNode>,
}
```

`StructureInterpreter` accepts only `NormalizedDocument`; no parser or PDF type
crosses the boundary. Structure version `1.0.0` emits one empty `Document` root
whose ordered children are `Section`, `Subsection`, or `Unstructured` nodes.
Each normalized block has exactly one canonical owning node. Nodes store block
IDs and their unchanged `SourceSpan` values, not rewritten source text.

Version 1 recognizes only a numeric prefix on the first non-empty block line.
Supported forms include `1`, `1. Introduction`, `1 Introduction`, `1) Introduction`,
and nested forms such as `1.1 Purpose`. A titled signal must begin with an
uppercase character, remain within 12 words and 120 characters, and not end as
a sentence. Components are `1..=999` and hierarchy depth is capped at six. A
nested signal is accepted only while its complete parent prefix is active;
duplicate, orphaned, malformed, year-like, lowercase-sentence, and other
ambiguous signals remain ordinary content. All-caps, short-line, filename, and
layout-based title guessing are not implemented.

Unnumbered blocks before the first accepted section are grouped as
`Unstructured`. After a section begins, ordinary blocks remain owned by the
active deepest section until another accepted heading changes the hierarchy.
This permits deterministic multi-page continuation. Page metadata is copied to
`StructurePage`, so empty/visual pages retain their order, warnings, and visual
routing without invented nodes.

Validation requires matching document/version identity, exact page metadata,
one deterministic root, valid parent/level relationships, deterministic unique
node IDs, heading labels and levels re-derived from their first source block,
exact source spans, and depth-first block references equal to every normalized
block exactly once in canonical order. The owned recursive value
representation cannot encode reference cycles. Schema v4 persists the artifact,
document/run association, structure version, serialized JSON, and SHA-256
integrity hash. Artifact insertion, `STRUCTURING -> STRUCTURED`, state-version
increment, and immutable event append share one transaction.

## `ChunkedDocument` (Slice 5)

```rust
pub struct ChunkedDocument {
    pub document_id: String,
    pub chunking_version: String,
    pub chunks: Vec<DocumentChunk>,
    pub warnings: Vec<PipelineWarning>,
}

pub struct DocumentChunk {
    pub chunk_id: String,
    pub ordinal: u32,
    pub structure_node_id: String,
    pub text: String,
    pub block_ids: Vec<String>,
    pub source_spans: Vec<SourceSpan>,
    pub warnings: Vec<PipelineWarning>,
}
```

`DocumentChunker` accepts canonical `NormalizedDocument` plus its
`StructuredDocument`; it has no parser, PDF, UI, or model dependency. Chunking
version `1.0.0` groups blocks only within a top-level structural owner and
splits between normalized blocks when adding another block would exceed the
12,000-character target. A single oversized block remains intact and receives
`CHUNK_EXCEEDS_TARGET`; chunking never rewrites or truncates authoritative
normalized text to satisfy the target.

Chunk text is the exact ordered block text joined by two LF characters for
later prompt construction. Each deterministic chunk ID is derived from the
document, chunking version, ordinal, structural owner, block IDs, and resulting
text. Validation requires canonical ordinals, unique deterministic identities,
one top-level owner per chunk, exact block/source-span association, and 100%
normalized-block coverage exactly once in source order. Documents without
native text produce no invented chunks and receive `NO_TEXT_TO_CHUNK`.

Explicit schema v5 persists the chunking version, artifact JSON, document/run
association, creation time, and SHA-256 integrity hash. Artifact insertion,
`CHUNKING -> CHUNKED`, state-version update, and immutable event append share
one transaction. Retrieval verifies integrity and stored metadata before the
artifact is returned.

## Local summary artifacts

`ModelRuntime` is the only inference boundary. `AnalyzedDocument` preserves one
ordered analysis per source chunk with the chunk's exact source spans.
`SynthesizedDocument` references every chunk ID exactly once in source order.
`VerifiedDocument` preserves the synthesis text and source coverage without
rewriting it. The current verification is mechanical, not semantic, and always
adds `SEMANTIC_VERIFICATION_DEFERRED`.

The first runtime adapter is configured with `DOC_SUM_MODEL_BASE_URL`,
`DOC_SUM_MODEL_NAME`, `DOC_SUM_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, and optional
`DOC_SUM_MODEL_API_TOKEN_FILE`. It accepts only plain HTTP on exact IPv4 or IPv6
loopback, disables proxies and redirects, and reads a bounded token file owned
by this application. It never reads another application's credential store.
Document text is marked as untrusted data in both prompts, and model output is
stored only as text; it cannot invoke pipeline actions.

Analysis version, synthesis version, verification version, and summary version
are each `1.0.0`. Schema versions 6 through 9 add separate durable tables for
the three checkpoints and final summary. Each row records the run/document,
stage version, serialized artifact, creation timestamp, and SHA-256 row hash.
The final `SummaryArtifact` also carries a content integrity hash over its
identity, version, text, warnings, and timestamp. Retrieval checks both layers.

The application service composes ingestion, parsing, normalization, structural
interpretation, chunking, analysis, synthesis, verification, and completion.
The Tauri command only selects concrete adapters, invokes that service, and
returns `CompletedSummary`; the frontend only selects a file and renders the
returned text.

Current limits are conservative: source chunks and one-pass synthesis input
are each capped at 100,000 Unicode characters. A native-text-free document or
an input beyond those limits fails with a structured domain error; no summary
text is invented. Hierarchical synthesis, OCR/vision routing, citations, and
semantic fact verification remain deferred.
